Japanese Hiragana chart for xKeyboard
-------------------------------------

### Usage

To use this chart you should copy the jph file to your `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols` directory.

After it's there, you can access it using `setxkbmap jph`.

### About

This is a work-in-progress xKeyboard keymap for Japanese Hiragana. I put it together based on an American-style keyboard with Japanese hiragana overlay.

### IMPORTANT

I've never had any experience with Japanese-style keyboards, so this keymap has a good chance of being incorrect. If you DO have a Japanese keyboard and find that this is incorrect, please leave me an Issue or create a Pull Request with any changes that need to be made.
